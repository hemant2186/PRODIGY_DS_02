Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. In this task, I have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a well-known dataset, focusing on uncovering relationships between variables and identifying patterns and trends.

## Dataset

For this task, I used the [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), which contains passenger information such as age, gender, ticket fare, class, and survival status.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib \& Seaborn for visualization


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**The EDA process included the following steps:**

1. **Data Cleaning**
    - Checked for missing values in key columns (Age, Cabin, Embarked) and handled them via imputation or removal.
    - Removed duplicate entries for data integrity.
    - Inspected distributions to detect and handle outliers, especially in 'Fare' and 'Age'.
2. **Univariate Analysis**
    - Explored the distribution of core features: Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived using histograms and bar charts.
3. **Bivariate \& Multivariate Analysis**
    - Analyzed the relationship between ticket class and survival rate.
    - Explored survival distributions for different genders and age groups.
    - Used correlation matrices and heatmaps to visualize relationships between features.
    - Visualized key patterns with stacked bar charts and boxplots.

## Key Findings

- **Passenger Class \& Survival:** First-class passengers had much higher survival rates than those in second or third class.
- **Gender \& Survival:** Female passengers were significantly more likely to survive.
- **Age Patterns:** Children (under 16) had better survival rates than adults.
- **Fare Correlation:** Passengers who paid higher fares tended to survive more.
- **Missing Values:** Managed significant missing data in 'Age' and 'Cabin' with median imputation and omission, respectively.


## Conclusion

This EDA exercise revealed crucial insights into how factors like class, gender, and age affected survival on the Titanic. The process establishes a strong foundation for subsequent analysis and predictive modeling.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
