# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 2

Perform data cleaning and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset

For this task, I used the [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), a widely used dataset for classification and EDA exercises. The dataset contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, such as their age, sex, ticket fare, class, and survival status.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib \& Seaborn for visualization


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process included the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**
    - Checked for missing values in key columns (Age, Cabin, Embarked) and addressed them via imputation or removal as appropriate.
    - Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
    - Handled outliers, particularly in the 'Fare' and 'Age' columns, by inspecting distributions and applying thresholds where needed.
2. **Univariate Analysis**
    - Explored the distribution of individual variables such as Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived.
    - Visualized distributions using histograms and bar charts for both categorical and continuous features.
3. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
    - Analyzed the relationship between passenger class and survival rates.
    - Explored survival distribution across genders and age groups.
    - Used correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify strong correlations between features.
    - Created stacked bar charts and boxplots to visualize key patterns.

## Key Findings

- **Passenger Class and Survival:** First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to second and third class.
- **Gender and Survival:** Female passengers were much more likely to survive than male passengers.
- **Age Distribution:** Children (age < 16) had a higher chance of survival compared to adults.
- **Fare:** Passengers who paid higher fares generally had higher survival rates.
- **Missing Values:** Notable missing data in 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns, addressed with median imputation for 'Age' and omission for 'Cabin'.


## Conclusion

This EDA exercise revealed critical patterns and relationships in the Titanic dataset, especially regarding how passenger class, gender, and age influenced survival rates. The process provides a foundation for further predictive modeling and feature engineering in subsequent data science workflows.
